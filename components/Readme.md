# Stylin Components

An opinionated set of components built with the stylin library.

- Sizing is base around a base property `gridRowHeight`.
- Components should not include surrounding white-space.
- Instead white-space is handled by specific layout components such as stack and row.
- Text blocks are trimmed so that their upper boundary aligns with cap-height and their lower boundary is the baseline.
